            Hello my name is Alexander Ramirez. 
            <br />
            I am a Front End Web Developer with a certificate in Full Stack Web Development from 
            Southern Methodist University with a background in customer support, team driven activities and 
            Spanish speaking abilities. With skills gained in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL Node, SQL, 
            React, Express, GitHub, Heroku, Bootstrap, and Handlebars to name a few. With the ability to apply my 
            customer service background to work as a team or independently in order to execute projects from 
            conception to completion. Iâ€™m excited to leverage my skills as part of a fast-paced, 
            quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web.
